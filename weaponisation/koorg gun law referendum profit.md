Why imo koorg law referendun will imo reduce total 'preventable' deaths, even when KLR might increase murders.imo 
.
Say KLR passes and all get 2 pistols and 2 ak47. Say murder rate in Bharat increases to as high as usa. That means say 60000 more murders per years

But total prevebtable deaths imo may decrease.

(1) Now if all had guns, lockdown deaths may have been much lower or zero. So that's about 20 lakh lives saved 

(2) if all had guns, forced vax would have been near zero. So there may have been much fewer vax deaths. Some 2 crore may have died due to vax. So that's about 1 crore lives saved

(3) guns4all promotes elitemen to ensure that all get food. That's again a few lakh lives saved. Gun4all promotes elitemen to reduce poverty. And poverty kills lakhs. 

(4) guns4all promotes elitemmen to improve court speed. That reduces economic inefficiency and that too translates in some lives saved

(5) in case war, gunlessness means total enslavement or huge loss of lives and property. That can be crores of lives saved.

So gun4qll imo may increase net life expentency even though total murders may increase

And gun murders can be decreased by narcotest in public
