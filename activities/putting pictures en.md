re : putting my pictures on pamphlets .

.

Except EVM, pls dont put my picture on any pamphlets. In fact, imo, pls dont put anyone's pictures except candidate and local activists.  In EVM , I am discoverer of BlackGlass LightSensor logics. So putting my picture on demo boxes / pamhplets is ethically justified. And imo, its may make it difficult for prince rahul ghandhy , mahatma arvind ghandy etc to create perception that EBG ELS was made by someone else.

But for all else, DRAFTS are final. And I have only re-discovered MRCM logic and I am not orginal inventor,. Thomas Paine and Henry George had already made it public. Even publicization of RTR  in Bharat isnt original work - Mahtama Pathik had done that in 1920s !!! So there is no "originality of first creation". Its only re-discovery.

So on all pamphlets, pls put picture of LOCAL candidates, local activists and may add picture of shaheeds. ( I dont put pictures of shaheeds except Rashtrapita Bose and AMUS). But pls dont put my pictures. And any other senior.

Picture of candidates must be put on ALL pamphlets including non election pamphlets and all draft pamphlets. Because voters need to know whom they are voting. And pictures of local activists can be added. If and when we have CM PM candidates, we may add pictures of them. But we are far far away from that.
