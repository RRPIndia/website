Bharatiya soldiers have made zones in southern manipur informally called as kuki zones.

The bharatiya soldiers don't allow any hindu meiti to go in that zone, even if he had his own land house there. Bharatiya soldiers allow only kukies to go in that zone !!!

The Congress MP imo is a nonsense person. But information he is giving is something imo all Bharatiya must know . [https://www.facebook.com/share/v/17cFRWqKwD/](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/17cFRWqKwD/) . .
