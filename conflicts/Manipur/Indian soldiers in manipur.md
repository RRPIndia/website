I request all to ask Manipuri Meitei if Bharatita soldiers will protect people of Bharat or just walk away, as per orders of usukwme. 

( word soldiers includes all, from PM  to general to major to juniormost soldier)
.
My opinion , MY OPINION,  since year 2006, has been that - Bharatiya soldiers since year 1999, are completely under usukwme control. 

Kargil war was between usa and bharat. Pakistan was just a pawn hired by usa. And usa decisively won the Kargil war and bharatiya soldiers were decisively defeated all 4 corners. Since then, bharatiya soldiers have accepted supremacy of usukwme. So in manipur, when orders came from usukwme to bharatiya soldiers, to keep quiet, they just kept quiet and they allowed Burmese kukies with ak47 to kill, arson, loot and allowed Burmese kukies to expel all meitei from their rural forest lands 

So when bharat pakistan and bharat china war starts, bhartiaya soldiers will obey usukwme by letter and spirit. Just as Ukrainian soldiers are obeying usukwme. Recently, Ukrainian soldiers looted people of Ukraine, took away all mineral rights, and sold away all mineral rights to usukwme. Bharatiya soldiers may do same

Solution?

I am trying to organize referendum in each district of Bharat whether district wants koorg gun law in their district or not. We call it DKGLR or KLR. My vote in ahmedabad referendum will be YES. 

If koorglaw comes, then all will have 2 pistols and 2 ak47. And so citizens dependence on bharatiya soldiers will reduce. And if all have guns, then  pakistan usa will not send terror in pahalgam or anywhere in bharat.
