## How US won Kargil war, and India and Pakistan both lost Kargil war

There are points that [Mediamen](http://127.0.0.1:8080/w/index.php/Paid_Media "Paid Media") _(who are under US influence because they get huge advertisements from MNCs)_ never ever told us. But a cursory glance at key events will show that India and Pakistan both lost the Kargil war, and it was US which won that war.

Essentially, US had decided to teach the then PM **Atal Bihary Vajpayee** a lesson for defying US and yet conducting nuclear tests. So US assisted General Musharraf in placing Pakistani troops on Kargil mountains.

When war started, we did not have laser guided missiles or even laser guided bombs to hit the insurgents who were at the top of the mountain. The planes and helicopters had to fly low to hit the targets, and in the process we lost our planes and helicopters.

The Bofors shells were useful in hitting the enemy on the mountain, but they were of limited use, as the precision is not that high and so over most shells will fall way too far to create substantial damage.

And so we had to ask 1000s of our soldiers to climb the mountain. The enemy was at the top, our soldiers were climbing up and so they got shot in huge number.

And to make matter worse, even the Bofors shells were imported as we did not have capability to manufacture even the shells. And the rate at which we needed to use the shells, we would have run of shells in months. And US dictated the terms at which we would get Bofors shells.

At the same time, the helicopters etc which Pakistan needed to send goods etc infiltrators needed parts made in European NATO countries which are also under US control.

So when US President Clinton asked Musharraf and Nawaz Sharif to stop the war, both had to obey. And when **Clinton** asked India’s PM ABV to give safe passage at **2 AM in the morning of July-25**, ABV had to obey,

and within 2 hours India announces safe passage to the Pakistani soldiers. So all in all, India lost the war – it could not even kill the Pakistani soldiers who had entered India and killed 800 Indian soldiers. Pakistan too had lost, as they had to leave on US orders and could not even carry the dead bodies of their dead soldiers back.

If ABV had not obeyed Clinton like a good obedient boy, then US would have blocked the supply of Bofors shells and provided all help to Pakistan, in which case Pakistan would have won.

If Musharraf had not obeyed Clinton, then Clinton would have increased aid to India and blocked all aid to Pakistan, in which case Pakistan would have imploded. **It was US which won the war.**

When Kargil war started, we did ask Russia, France, US and several countries to sell us laser guided missiles and laser guided bombs. But none sold us till the last moment. At last moment we could buy some laser guided bombs to kill the infiltrators at the top of the mountains.

### Improving weapon manufacturing industry

Here I request the reader to note one point : if we were manufacturing laser guided missiles and laser guided bombs, not even one soldier of India would have died. Without risking the life of even one soldier, we would have killed all infiltrating Pakistani soldiers using laser guided bombs and laser guided missiles.

This where Military heavily depends on civilian departments. Because of corruption in PM, FinMin etc, we could not develop these weapons. All in all, given the corrupt polity we had since the death of Indira Amma, our weapon manufacturing program is in shambles. And we need to fix this ASAP.

  
One of the core demand of Right to Recall Party is to make ALL necessary changes in economy and polity so that India’s ability to manufacture weapons comes at par with US.
