13-sep-1929 ---- Mahatma Jatindra Nath Das passes away due to 65 days of hunger and torture. No Mohanvaadi ever died fasting. Some real fasters do die.

in whole country, Mahatma Bhagat Singh , Mahatma Dutt et al become 10 to 100 times more famous than Mohanbhai. Mohanbhai develops fever and depression when he saw that everyone was praising Mahatma Bhagat Singh and he was losing his no. 1 position
