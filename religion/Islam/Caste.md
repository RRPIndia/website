China in past 2000 years has seen 10s of peasant rebellions , where common farmers formed armies and fought against Emperor's professional armies. Most rebellions failed to grow big, and many failed even after growing big. But sometimes , rebellions were so strong , and also organized, that whole dynasties got overthrown.
.
India , before 1750, has only one case of mass peasant rebellion --- Yadavs organizing under Krishna , and executing the King Kansa, 
.
So how come China had so many rebellions, while India had just one?

Chanakya must have had several talented Bhramin / Rajvarg (Kshatriya) students. Yet, why did Chanakya decide to raise Chandragupta Maurya, an "obc"? Was it just a conincident? Or did caste play any INDIRECT role or direct role? Why didnt Chanakya himself became Emperor (pls dismiss the tale that he had teeth when he was born and teeth were brushed off by his father. Such tales have no value).

Chanakya purged most of the Ministers of Dhanananda. But one Minister named as Amatya Rakshaha was made senior Minister in council of Chandragupta !! Pls decide why was he not only spared, but given such apex position.Hint : what religion / panth did  Amatya Rakshaha followed? What was his caste?

What was the caste of Dhanananda ? What religion / panth did he follow?

Likewise, Shivaji too was an "OBC" (kunbi). Which is why the apex Rajpurohits of his days in whole Maharashtra region had refused to do his coronation (rajyabhishek). And he was coronated by Gaga Bhatt , a Purohit from Varanasi,. And gaga Bhat coronated him, because he needed someone to fight against Aurangzeb because Aurangzeb had destroyed the Kashi Vishvanath temple he owned. And no other king was willing to fight against Aurangzeb  except Shivaji. And before cornoration, Gaga Bhat had to discover (or fabricate?) "evidences" (or tales) that Shivaji was progeny (vanshaj) of Sisodia Kings of Rajasthan , and thus Shivaji was true Rajput aka Kshatriya and not a kunbi !!! 
.
So why is that no Brahmin / Kshatriya King became so popular / strong as Shivaji ? Is that no one tried? Was it just coinsidence? Or did caste play any INDIRECT or direct role?

NaMo never said that "I am OBC , and so I should get preference". But it is fact that Govindacharya in mid 1990s proposed that OBC / dalit leaders in BJP should be groomed. And so several OBC / dalit leaders were promoted at top such as NaMo, Sadhvi Uma Bharati, Bangaru Laxman and many many more. NaMo surely has his merits --- NO SARCASM. I repeat, NaMo does have many merits. But surely BJP had many talented Brahmin , Kashatriya, Patels etc. Was NaMo the most meritorious? Or did NaMo's OBC caste also played some INDIRECT or direct role in his promotions inside BJP? Google and decide.

Moral of the story is ---- caste in India has been reality, and  is still a reality. Which is why, my proposal is to PUBLISH caste of EVERY individual in an online universally available and universally verifiable list / database. All this talk of "hide everyone's caste" is nonsense. I disregard caste of everyone I meet. I repeat ---- I completely disregard caste of everyone I meet. But I believe that everyone has right to believe that I am casteist, and so he has right to know my caste (which is  Bania, Jain Hindu). IOW, even if no one is casteist, everyone has right to believe that everyone is casteist !! And so caste details of ALL should be public.
