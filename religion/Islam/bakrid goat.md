IMO, it is foolish to oppose crackers on Diwali, foolish to oppose use of water in Holi and foolish to oppose goat slaughter on ID
.
Missionaries started prompting mockery of Hindus on use of water in Holi and crackers in Diwali. Not even one Muslim I know oppose use of water in Holi and use of crackers in Diwali. And now missionaries started prompting opposing goat slaughter on ID. and sadly, 10000s and lakhs and crores of Hindus on FB have started mocking goat slaughter on ID !!! What a nonsense !! These fools will dance the way Missionaries want them to dance
,
The whole argument that "someone oppose use of water in Holi and someone opposed fire cracker in Diawali and so I will mock goat slaughter in ID" shows lack of IQ. Did the person who is slaughtering goat on ID even opposed water in Holi and ever opposed firecrackers in Diwali ? NO. So why should any Hindu make goat slaughter on ID an issue?
.
Cow is pious to us Hindus and cow has many advantages in medicine, farming etc. But other animals dont have much any high status in Hinduism. Many Hindus are vegertarian and oppose animal slaughter in general. But that is only 20% to 25% of all Hindus. Over 75% Hindus eat chicken, goat, lamb and even buffalo. So banning animal slaughter is no go even in Hindus.
.
So if animal slaughter is legal, and then why mock slaughter of (non-cow) animal on one specific day which is important to believers? If anyone slaughter cow, he should be should be imprisoned, but that is a separate case. Likewise, camel slaughter too is banned and those who slaughter camel should be arrested. If someone is slaughtering goat etc, then bny mocking him, we are only helping Missionaries who want Hindu Muslim tension in India to increase
.
There are valid reasons why tension exists --- Ram Janam Bhoomi, Kashmir, population control etc. On all this VALID issue, if tension increases, then I say -- let it increase. But I see no point in mocking their religious practice which are 100% legal, and also part of diet of over 70% Hindus.
.
The reason why "all should slaughter goat on same day" has logic. In desert areas, vegetable/fruits are scarce and so problem of vitamin deficiency is chronic. There is a lot of grass, but humans cant digest it. So people in such desert areas use goats to feed grass and then use goat meat, 
.
Now why have a festival where "all" should slaughter goat on same day?
.
The organ which is most nutritious in terms of vitamins and minerals is liver. So when goat or lamb were slaughtered in general, the liver is sold at much higher price and so it is out of reach for most poor. But if all well off persons are asked to slaughter goat on SAME day, then on that day. supply of livers will be so high that poorest of poorest will also manage to get some liver. So historically speaking, the festival or ritual or barki-id has had value in muslim societies. 
.
Now consider a muslim who says "I will not eat meat on most days, but I will eat meat on bakri-id day because it is my religion". And consider a non-muslim who says "I will eat meat as and when I feel, but I will mock bakri id as stupid festival". Then it may turn out that that muslim is killing LESSER number of goats in a year !!  IOW, killing goat on one day, doesnt necessaily mean that one is killing more animals than someone who doesnt celebrate bakri id. 
.
So first, bakri id aka "all well off must slaughter goat on same day" has served use in past islamic societies. It may be less relevant today. But then, goat slaughter is 100% legal. And if vegetarianism has merit from health and environment point of view, then also slaughtering goat on one specific day doesnt do much damage, given that slaughter happens round the year anyway.
.
So those who mock use of water on holi, are not doing it to save water. they do it ONLY to ,mock Hinduism, and those who mock firecrackers on Diwali dont do it for sake of reducing air pollution. They do it ONLY to mock Hinduism., And those who mock slaughter of goat on id are NOT doing it from point of view of promoting vegetarianism or enviornment. They are doing it ONLY to insult islam. And all three cases of mocking are sponsored by Missionaries to increase Hindu-Muslim tension in India. 
.
So my request to all is --- promoting vegetarianism has its merit, but that does NOT reqyuire mocking goat slaughter on id. Just as saving water and reducing air pollution does NOT require stopping use of water on holi and not using fire crackers. So IMO , by mocking goat slaughter on bakri-id, we are only promoting helping missionaries in their goal of worsening Hindu Muslim tension in India
