Many moons ago, I had asked a question --- afghanistan got freedom in 1919 AD while it took us 30 more years and that too after usuk-wme weakened due to ww2. And same today --- afghanistan got victory in current  round of afghanistan vs usuk-wme war. 
.
I had asked many to give their views on DIFFERENCE reasons.
.
One answer that came was "gathering" procedure which is at core of Islam
.
Well, then why Saudi Arabia is puppet of usuk-wme since 1910s? Saudi Arabia too has gathering and Islam etc since ages. In fact, ruling family of Saudi was Jewish till year 1880s !!! And they managed to displace and subdue all and become rulers !!!
.
So why gathering adds strength, there are many factors at play.
.
Also, afghanistan won the current round with help of china. And usukwme vs Afghanistan war is not over. In next round, usukwme are working to use India against China and Afghanistan using puppets like congress rss aap SP akalies etc. This only proves that ( recall + multielection + jury + referendum ) combo is far superior than gathering. But fact that Saudi Arabia is puppet of usukwme and Afghanistan is not, perhaps, shows that afghanistan has something more than gathering. If so, what is that?

( uskwme - usuk weapon manufacturing elitemen . They created nonsense words like capitalism , imperialism, NWO etc to hide importance of weapons so that activists can be misle
