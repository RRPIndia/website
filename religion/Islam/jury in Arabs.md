HOW JURY SYSTEM helped ARAB EMPIRE
=== ===== ==== 
What is Jury system- 
When judgement in court is given by randomly selected 12 citizens (Jury ) and not by Judges
===== ===== ===
Arab Sunni had used Jury System from 700 AD to 1000 AD. .And Imo, that was the MAIN reason behind their strength !!
.
Pls see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_trial#Islamic_Law
.
The lafif in Maliki jurisprudence developed between the 8th and 11th centuries and stipulated that 12 members of the community would swear to tell the truth and reach a unanimous verdict about matters "which they had personally seen or heard, binding on the judge, to settle the truth concerning facts in a case, between ordinary people, and obtained as of right by the plaintiff." In the 12th century, Henry II of England similarly instituted a jury system of 12 free men charged to uncover the facts of the case with the same characteristics as the lafif system. He was likely influenced by his exchequer, Thomas Brown, who formerly worked under the diwan of the Kingdom of Sicily which had recently conquered the Emirate of Sicily and incorporated Islamic government and legal systems into their procedures.

So this further proves the assertion I made in around year 1999 , that country which has Jury System will become stronger than countries which do not have Jury System !!! 
.
Of course, every historian / intellectual etc across India and world opposes this pro-Jury notion !!

 across world, economic and political elitemen work to weaken and end jury system. And they have so far been successful.

Mālik was once sentenced to a lashing by the governor of Medina, the cousin of Caliph Abū Ja‘far al-Manṣūr for narrating a hadith to the effect that a divorce obtained under coercion was invalid. The hadith in question had momentous political implications, because it supported those who argued that the caliph's authority was similarly invalid - because it, too, had been secured by means of coercion.
.
Eventually, Mālik was paraded through the streets in disgrace and ordered to insult himself publicly. He is reported to have said:
.
Whoever knows me, knows me; whoever does not know me, my name is Mālik ibn Anas, and I say: The divorce of the coerced is null and void!
When the incident was reported to al-Manṣūr, Mālik was ordered released, and his cousin was punished.

BAsically , those who support Jury System, become very unpopular in elitemen. So elitemen use every trick in book to disgrace him or even kill him. And all depends on activists. How many activists work to bring Jury System 
.
So elitemen work in ORGANIZED yaw to weaken and kill jury system. And so unless activists work to strengthen it, elitemen will be successful
