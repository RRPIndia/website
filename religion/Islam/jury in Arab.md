Arab Sunni had used Jury System from 700 AD to 1000 AD. .And Imo, that was the MAIN reason behind their strength !!
.
Pls see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_trial#Islamic_Law
.
The lafif in Maliki jurisprudence developed between the 8th and 11th centuries and stipulated that 12 members of the community would swear to tell the truth and reach a unanimous verdict about matters "which they had personally seen or heard, binding on the judge, to settle the truth concerning facts in a case, between ordinary people, and obtained as of right by the plaintiff." In the 12th century, Henry II of England similarly instituted a jury system of 12 free men charged to uncover the facts of the case with the same characteristics as the lafif system. He was likely influenced by his exchequer, Thomas Brown, who formerly worked under the diwan of the Kingdom of Sicily which had recently conquered the Emirate of Sicily and incorporated Islamic government and legal systems into their procedures.

So this further proves the assertion I made in around year 1999 , that country which has Jury System will become stronger than countries which do not have Jury System !!! 
.
Of course, every historian / intellectual etc across India and world opposes this pro-Jury notion !!
