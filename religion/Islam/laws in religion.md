The God, His Religion, His Scripture, the monthly rate of interest, the judge, the slavery, the poverty and The Jury !!!
,
Its quite amusing to me how lowly "worldly" lowly concept like "monthly rate of interest" and resulting concepts like judge, Jury etc can effect supernatural all powerful entities like Scriptures, Religion and even The Almighty God !!!
.
Before 1 ad, all religions allowed interest on loans. And inability to pay interest in most countries except Bharat was SLAVERY of man, and even his wife and even all his non adult sons and daughters !! .
.
Hinduism had banished slavery long back (before 1000 bc). And so legally, debt died at death and didnt get passed on to children.
The reason why Christianity flourished in Middle East and Europe and not in India till 1500 ad, was because Christianity after 200 ad worked to end slavery, while India had NO slavery to begin with !!!
Christianity also banned interest on loans. Because inability to pay loan means slavry, and usury can cause extreme lifelong poverty if not slavery. 
But while The God banned interest, commerce needed some form of lending and incetive to lend. So demand for non christian money lenders grew across Christian lands till 1200 ad (why not after 1200 ad?).
Islam created concept of Partnership in 550 ad, which Christianity could not create and could not even copy. Partnership means a person A who has skills and time both but no money and a person B who has money but no skills or no time create a Partnership. B gives say 100 gold coins to A, and B has to pay a % of profits till B gets back 110 gold coins or whatever is agreed addition. Upon payment of 110 gold coins, B keeps all his profits. But if activity goes bankrupt, then B loses money, and A is free man. He has moral and semi legan obligation to repay 110. But 110 doesnt become 120 or 130 no matter how many years pass. ie addition is FIXED and not monthly 
Hinduism continued with interest and mostly interest were high. 
So now say A is a skilled craftsman with skills but no capital. And X asks for neck breaking MONTHLY interest and Y asks for fixed extra profits. Where will A go?
And whose religion A will take, if BOTH put "accept my religion"as condition
Because of Partnership concept, trade and industry grew in faster in Islamic lands compared to Christian and other non muslim lands, which didnt have this mechanism. So islamic armies kept advancing 
But things changed in Europe in 1200 ad. And after that, advancement of islamic armies slowed, and by 1400 ad, they were being pushed back
