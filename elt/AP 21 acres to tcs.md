*AP govt sells 21 acre land to TCS for a HUGE whopping price of ..... Rs 21 !!!*  Yes. Rs 21 only. Not Rs 21 crore or Rs 21 lakhs or Rs 21000 . But a whopping price of Rs 21 only !!!

AP govt should have paid Rs 2100 crore to TCS to take this 21 acre land !! After all TCS is no. 1 tech company in whole world !!! TCS has made earth shaking products that put microsoft , google , FB, intel and even NVDIA to shame !!! Last I heard, every tech company CEO is afraid of TCS's high tech ability.

( solution I propose is Right to Recall over CM and narcotest in public in high corruption cases. )
Btw, there is zero corruption in all such land deals. If you have any proof of corruption, pls upload the evidences on FB twi and pls file PIL in SC. And if you didnt file PIL, then it proves that corruption was zero !!!
