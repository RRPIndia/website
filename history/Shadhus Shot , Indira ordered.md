old nov-1966 news --- why Devi Indira Amma ordered firing on Sadhus in nov-1966 : sadhus instigated by RSS-leaders were marching towards Parliament House, North/South Blocks (defence/finance ministry), and many had intention of burning down these buildings !! Loss of paper records would have been colossal to whole nation (back in 1966 , there were no xeroxes or digital copies). And so Devi Indira Amma ordered policemen to first use tear gas, and firing started only after they less than 200 meters close to these buildings.

Devi Indira had promised ban on cow slaughter and she did pass several state level laws in States where congress govts were in power, She did NOT print any national level law. 
.
The sadhus were instigated by the RSS-leaders to run a huge gathering near Boat Club,. They had promised that gathering will be peaceful and they will NOT walk outside the perimeter. But all of a sudden, many Sadhus, instigated by RSS-leaders, decided to march towards Parliament House, North Block, South Block etc. These buildings have most important papers of India. South Block and North Block are defence and finance ministry respectvely,. And Parliament House has most important record rooms for almost all Ministries. 
.
THERE WAS A SERIOUS POSSIBILITY THAT SOME WOULD HAVE RESORTED TO START FIRE IN THOSE BUILDINGS. So first tear gas and then firing was ordered by Devi Indira Amma

Since day one, I have said that those who want change should propose drafts, campaign for drafts and contest elections. I support PRATIK  (symbolic) anshan, dharana, rally etc, And I oppose fast till death and aggressive / prolonged dharana/rallies,. 
.
None stopped Sadhus from creating political electoral alternatives.  Sadhus were right till they had peaceful gathering, But they were wrong in starting an AGGRESSIVE UNPLANNED RALLY towards such sensitive important buildings which have papers of just congress, but whole India.
.
Now look at all irony and hypocrisy. RSS-leaders instigated all stir of Sadhus in nov-1966, And congress since 1851, had made it clear that there interest in goraksha is zero. Devi Indira did make a promise of Goraksha in 1965, and did pass state level laws, but she had never promised a national level laws. And after nov-1966, she made it clear that she will not pass any national level law. And since 1925,. RSS has been supporting and demanding national level law against gohatya. And they made a huge issue in 1966 and onwards. Today, RSS-leaders and RSS-workers are in power for over 4 years. Where is national level law against gohatya? 
.
And we had Yogi Adityanath , who proposed national level goraksha law in year 1996, and then again in 1998 and then again in year 2004 and again in year 2009. Why didnt he propose that law in jun-2014 or anytime later? And why doesnt he demand national level today?
.
And why dont the sadhus or their followers now ask for National Level law against cow slaughter? Most of the Sadhus have been campaigning for RSS = BJP since nov-1966. Why dont they do same type of rally today? Why dont they march towards Parliament House, South Block and North Bloc today? 
.
All in all, that march was not a FULL INFORMED decision of Sadhus, but done by INSTIGATION of RSS-leaders at last moment.The RSS-leaders fooled Sadhus into believing that once they march towards Parliament Hose and Finance/Defense Ministry buildings, they can get the law passed !! And policemen till last moment didnt expect gathering to cross perimeter and march towards Parliament House and important buildings like North/South Blocks. And so at last moment, they had no recourses like calling water cannons etc, So first, policemen threw tear gas shells, but that didnt stop the mob. And finally, when mob came too close, they had no option.

I have proposed some STATE LEVEL law-drafts that will end gohatya across India to near zero. The drafts are in https://www.facebook.com/groups/righttorecallparty/permalink/10152747542153103/ . 
.
The sadhus' decision to do an AGGRESSIVE march towards Parliament House Defence/Finance Ministry Buildings, with possibility as well as intenstion of burning down these buildings was wrong back then, and wrong even today. 
.
Those who want end to gohatya should contest elections. I dont support fasting / rally etc (except symbolic).
