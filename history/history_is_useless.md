if facts are useful, then how come 'history' aka 'past facts' is useless?

history is lot less than past facts and lot more than past facts. 

History is sentences written by present day or some past historians., of whom over 99% were all bikau. And they write on basis of archive which was written by "journalists" of past and based on some leftover of collapsed buildings aka "remains"

So archive writers of past wrote loads and lies and deleting many many facts, based on who gave how much money 

and modern day historians read them, and then they delete many sentences depending on who pays how much . 

So iven if one assumes that present day historians are facthiders, but dont lie, then also we have 

history = past facts * fact hiding by p;ast archive makers * lies thrown by past archive writers * fact hiding by today's historians !!! 

.

So history is lot less than facts and many lies added 

Instead, its better to study administration of today across world

( aside : events witnessed by all those alive or those whom you personally spoke to is PRESENT and NOT history. Thats will be about 100 years )
