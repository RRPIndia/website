Ullaskar Dutt was a prominent revolutionary, and his love story is one of the most remarkable ones you will ever come across.

 He was sentenced to Kalapani, where he underwent merciless torture, including repeated electrocution, which eventually took a toll on his mental health.

 Subsequently, he was transferred to a mental asylum in Madras. During his time in the asylum, the fleeting images of his college sweetheart, Leela, were the driving force that helped him navigate the trauma. 

After his release from the asylum, he managed to track Leela down, only to discover that she had gotten married, as she had no knowledge of his whereabouts or whether he was alive.

 Consequently, he resumed his revolutionary activities. Years later, he learned that Leela had become a widow and was paralyzed from the waist down. 

He tracked her down again, married her, took her to his village, and cared for her until her passing. In my opinion, this real-life love story surpasses any fictional narrative I have come across in movies.

( Leela was daughter of revolutionary Bipin Chandra Pal )
