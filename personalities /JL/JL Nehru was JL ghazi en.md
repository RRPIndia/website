Evidences that Jawaharlal's actual lastname was Ghazi 
(1) Taking Kashmir issue to UNO 
(2) there was no need for Indus Water Trearty. Take all water, and give whatever they pay, subject to good behavior. Yet Jawaharlal Ghazi signed it in 1960
(3) Wakf act 1954 gives previleges to Wakf more than normal trust. eg if land owned by any private entity or person X is occupied by someone Y for over 14 years, and Y has papers proving his possession and X makes no claim over it, then X loses rights and it becomes property of Y. But Wakf act 1954 makes this inapplicable on land claimed by Wakf ssh -p 8022 192.168.43.231!
(4) Likewise, property left by Muslims who migrated to pakistan between 1946 - 1948 was made Wakf property
