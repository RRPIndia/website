Devi Indira amma had to declare emergency because judges prompted by CIA had given non-sensical judgment cancelling her election victory and barring her from contesting elections for 6 years.
.
In a way, Devi Indira herself was also responsible --- she opposed Jury System and strengthened judges in many ways. And judges sold out. If election trial was given to Jury of 1500 voters chosen from across India, they would trashed the FRIVILOUS nonsense case within 3 days.

Devi Indira Amma divided Pakistan into two, did Pokharan-1 and was taking several steps to strengthen Indian Military. This was main reason why CIA started giving huge leaders, paidmediamen like Gokenka and judges to dethrone her. And Russians also didnt like Pokharan-1 and so they do decided to let CIA do the job of weakening Devi Indira Amma. .

She could have fought all these bikau leadersm bikau mediamen etc using Jury System. But she had anti-democracy temprament and so she opposed Jury System. So all powers was given to judges. And judge sold out, leaving her no option but to use raw force aka emergency. ni6
