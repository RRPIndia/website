Devi Indira Amma nationalized banks. Otherwise, all banks would have been private banks like Maharashtra Punjab bank. And citizens would have no option but to put money in such private banks only. 
.
Back then  , RSS and Atalji has opposed nationalization of banks..
.
Today, congress rss aap workers and soga namo arke want to privatise all banks. And eventually hand them over to goraa.
.
Only we at right to recall party are working to stop that
