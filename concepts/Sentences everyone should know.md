I want to add following sentences in common knowledge of all 95 crore Bharatiya voters. 
.
(1) over 75% judges in usa are directly elected by citizens. And elected or unselected, most are recallable. And appointed judges are appointed by elected state heads approved by legislatures.
.
(2) over 90% district police heads aka sheriff are elected directly by voters. 
.
(3) over 90% of district public prosecutors in usa are directly elected by voters. And most are recallable 
.
Adding these sentences in common knowledge of all 95 crore Bharatiya voters is imo all activists should do


**Solution**

fastest way to add a sentence in common knowledge is - force PM to put that sentence on PM's pinned post on FB, twi etc !!!

next step - you can ask an activist - can you tweet PM to put this sentence on PM's profile? And next step - ask activist - can activist ask his SENIOR to ask PM to put this sentence on PM's profile. 
.
There is a limit - it will apply on FACTS, and proposals that are already accepted as "easy" and "good"





.
(.1.1) We can ask PM to put Hp2010 vdo on PM's FB twi profile, because Hp2010 vdo is fact as it uses ECI evm. 

(1.2) But we CANNOT ask PM to put EBG demo on PM's profile, because EBG demo uses homemade evm. 

(2.1) We can ask PM to put sentence "PM will soon make Gov Plot List public" on PM's profile. 

(2.2) But we CANNOT ask PM to put SaJaKiBe draft on PM's profile because SaJaKiBe is known to just a few thousand

(3.1) We can ask PM to put sentence "PM will soon make all mineral outout and royalty paid for all 1 sqkm bliock public , every month". 
.
(3.2). But we CANNOT ask PM to put KhaMBa on PM's website as KhaMBa is not well accepted.
.
(4.1) We cannot ask PM to put facts like "70% judges in USA are elected" etc on PM's website as they are not part of his job. 
.
Now after we have asked PM to put a sentence on PM's profile, we can ask an activist to ask PM to put that sentence om PM profile.

So our SPECIFIC request to actvist we meet can be be 

(1.1) can you ask PM to put Hp2010 vdo on PM's FB twi profile?
.
(2.1) can you ask PM to put Gov Plot List on PM's website 

(3.1) can you ask PM to put Mineral output royalty data on PM's website 

And next is more interesting. We can ask activist to ask his seniro to take above  3 steps !!!
.
(1.1) can you ask your senior to ask PM to put Hp2010 vdo on PM's FB profile?
.
(2.1) can you ask your senior to ask PM to put Govt plot list on PM's website?
.
(3.1) can you ask your senior to ask PM to put mineral output and royalty collected for each 1sqmt plot every month on PM's website?
.
these 3 sentences, will be imo fastest way for us to convince an activist that his senior is real or fake
