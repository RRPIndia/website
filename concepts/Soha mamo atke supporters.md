Supporters of namo arke soga prashantT etc are often single cause supporters.

.

So we need to cite sentence which convice them wholly or partly, that their leaders are wrong on their cause. Not try to prove that other causes are more imp

Eg1. namo supporters. They consider islamist terror as singlemost imp cause. As per them, all other issues such as corruption, poverty etc are irrelevant. They dont know about manipur issue. And also don't know that rss since year 2014 has been allowing in Bangladeshies for cash. So for them, islamist terror is so imp issue that all issues are irrelevant. Even conversion of poor Hindus from Hinduism to Buddhism or Christianity is now unimportant for them. As per them, namo with all his corruption etc is only one who can save them from islamist terror. Without namo as PM, they see islamists ending their lives and all wealth. So no matter what damages namo is doing, they want namo and no one else.

Now many of these are media created fake imagery.

They have near zero information about manipur and also not much about conversion of poor Hindus into Buddhism and Christianity.

Eg2 raga supporters. Muslims believe that namo will end their citizenship using caa nrc and expel them. And raga is a savior . And many sc st once believe that rss namo will end caste based reservation and so they fear from rss. And they see raga as savior

Eg3 arke supporters. They dislike raga namo for valid reasons. And see arke as some warrior.

Eg4 prashanT supporters. Some of his supporters are just spiritual people, who just want moksha even if bharat becomes another Ukraine or worse. To some, he has convinced that global warming is only relevant problem and all problems such as poverty, corruption, collapse of religion , collapse of nation are irrelevant. And only PrasanhT has solution to co2 problem !!! PT has also said that removing poverty will increase global warming and so attempt to remove poverty is bad for poor !!! And he adds usual anti rich masala talks creating an anti establishment aura.

So 'focusing on only one cause, and ignore ALL other causes' is one major problem with their supporters. They all have been convinced to focus only on one problem and ignore all other problems.

So asking them to spend time on any other cause B , needs to first show, thar B seriously impacts their imp cause A.

And next, that RRP solution to A or B is better than namk
