head of gathering and Misuse of courts admin etc

One most common misuse of courts admin legislatures has been - existing manufacturers with large market share try to shut down factories of smaller players, particularly newcomers. 

And another common misuse is to create "victimless crimes" and collect fines and bribes from "criminals" who commit victimless crimes !! One such victimless crimes is manufacturing and selling 'illegal' liquor , drugs. 

And there are many more. eg land loot, bank loot, mineral loot, adding pollutants in water food medicine, forced medication etc

Common knowledge helps in reduce above misuses. CK is sentences or images or data that all know, and all know that all know. CK may be just a belief or may be fact or a lie. And it can be belief known as belief or a belief which acceopted as fact. 

Now weekly or fortnighly or even monthly gathering has been one procedure which enabled population to obtain and communicate information, and create common knowledge.

Other process that create communucation and common knoweldge are mass media , jury , referendum, elections and recall. Jury is gathering of 12, but 1000s of such gathering every week across country and across year creates same communication as if there was one gathering of whole population in a year. Refrendum also creates common knowledge because each has to vote and before voting, he will discuss. And so does election and recall.

Now all these tools - mass media, jury, referendum, election, recall - need govt or elitemen funding. And their support.

Now all gatherings need a moderator who decides who will speak for how many minutes. In religious gathering, priest or maulvi is the moderator, and also often a speaker. But they also allow or disallow others to speak. 

Now if elitemen have strong control over priests/maulvies,  then elitemen's ability to crush newcoming manufacturer will increase. However, if elitemen have LESS control over priests/maulvies, then elitemen will have less control in crushing newcoming manufacturers. 

Imo, Popeism (ie a central Pope will appoint all priests) enabled elitemen to increase control over all priests, via elitemen control over Pope and Cardinals. And elite manufacturers will use it to crush newcomers

.

And this was imo main reason why manufacturing under Islamic Kings was better than Christian Kings bwteween 600 ad to 1200 ad. Otherwise, when Arab conquered Jeruslam in 638 ad, the Arabs were far far less wealthier than Kings and officers who were ruling Jerusalem. And Arab armies were not very small, but smaller than Armies of so called the them Holy Roman Eastern Empire, which ruled over middle east. Despite less wealth, they were able to make better weapons !!!  And so despite not so big armies, there were able to dedeat quite large armies.

Also, election process reduces elitemen's control over the position. This is why most elitemen have always hated election of judges or even election of MP MLA for that matter. But activists in USA were able to ensure by 1792 that all sheriffs (full police chiefs back then) , MP MLA Prez Gov are all elected. And were able to ensure that judges are elected by 1810s. And by 1860s, most district public public prosecutors were also elected. And of course, there was JurySys. Imo, these elections and Juries weakened elitemen's ability to stop newcomers via courts admin etc. And so USA has best manufacturing,.

( Now JurySys is weakened by allowing judge to select as many as 500 of citizens as potential jurors, and then expel as many as  80% as "biased". Which makes JurySys a defacto judge trial !!! why activists in USA are supporting a weakening of JurySys a separate topic, which I will discuss later )
