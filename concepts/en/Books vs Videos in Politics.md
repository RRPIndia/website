Why Maths / Physics books are successful , while videos have proved to be "useless". And why RTR books / pamphlets are successful, while RTR videos too are not of much use? And why SoMoKe's videos are extremely successful?
.
Those who had watched video on maths / physics THINK that they had  understood the topic. But when they are asked questions wrt to the topics they had watched, they failed to answer even the simple questions. Whereas the students who had read books did better. And students who had solved numerical examples did far better.
.
This video from Veritasium doesnt compare books vs video, but does compare how ineffective science videos are ---- "the Effectiveness of Science Videos at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVtCO84MDj8 ". The video only talks about inefficiencies of science video. It doesnt compare books vs video. For comparing efficiency of books vs video, pls google,. 
.
And same also applies to software programming . On neve learns anything from vidoes. One learns software ONLY by coding and by reading books or e-books or manuals or specific webpages which describe API.In software, books have been replaced by webpages. But same principles applies --- videos dont help only coding and reading helps.
.
Some students read books on their own. Some have to be forced to read books. Sometimes, they force themselves, Sometimes people around them will force themselves. But finally, only those who read books grasp the matter, and those who see video ONLY THINK that have understood the topic, but gain nothing.
.
And what is better than reading is solving numerical examples wrt the topic. 
.
RTR-movement is about bringing law drafts. This involves comparing the proposed law-drafts with existing law-drafts , and also compare law-drafts proposed by us recallists with law-drafts proposed by SoMoke , CoBhApSwaRa-leaders etc. This is mathematical / logical exercise. I do make videos on it and also write books / pamphlets / fb-posts. But those who have watched videos ONLY have not convinced even one person to support RTR-drafts or send orders to MPs via SMS. Whereas those who read books / pamphlets / fb-posts convinced 10s to 100s of voters to send orders to MPs via SMS. 
.
The reason is --- watching video does NOT add skills to answer doubts that audience asks , when they hear about RTR-law-drafts. So when a person watched RTR-videos ONLY , and when he presented RTR-law-drafts to someone else. he faced questions, he failed to answer. But those who were reading books / pamphlets etc could answer critical questions, and convince audience to support RTR-drafts and send orders to MPs via SMS .
So all in all, videos didnt add ,much to goal of publicizing RTR-drafts. Only books, pamphlets and fb-posts did.

.
Then why are vidoes of SoMoke extremely "successful"? The vidoes of SoMoke only promote heroes, and not any law-drafts. The goal of SoMoKe is ONLY to entertain viewers and keep them interested, not to inform them about what law-drafts can reduce the mess. So their videos are successful in promoting themselves. As per reducing difference between USA and India, SoMoKe neither have plan , nor have any interest. They are NOT in this race at all.
.
All in all, videos may be helpful for end voters , but not activists...
.
Solution is that activists should focus on reading books, pamphlets and fb-posts and not spend and not spend much time on video.
