I want to add following sentences in common knowledge of all 95 crore Bharatiya voters.

1. over 75% judges in usa are directly elected by citizens. And elected or unselected, most are recallable. And appointed judges are appointed by elected state heads approved by legislatures.
2. over 90% district police heads aka sheriff are elected directly by voters.
3. over 90% of district public prosecutors in usa are directly elected by voters. And most are recallable

Adding these sentences in common knowledge of all 95 crore Bharatiya voters is imo all activists should do

  

### Solution

fastest way to add a sentence in common knowledge is - **force PM to put that sentence on PM's pinned post on FB, twi etc** !!!

next step - you can ask an activist - can you tweet PM to put this sentence on PM's profile? And next step - ask activist - can activist ask his SENIOR to ask PM to put this sentence on PM's profile. . There is a limit - it will apply on FACTS, and proposals that are already accepted as "easy" and "good"

  

  

1. 1. We can ask PM to put Hp2010 vdo on PM's FB twi profile, because Hp2010 vdo is fact as it uses ECI evm.

1. 1. But we CANNOT ask PM to put EBG demo on PM's profile, because EBG demo uses homemade evm.

1. 1. We can ask PM to put sente.

1. 1. But we CANNOT ask PM to put KhaMBa on PM's website as KhaMBa is not well accepted.

1. 1. We cannot ask PM to put facts like "70% judges in USA are elected" etc on PM's website as they are not part of his job.

. Now after we have asked PM to put a sentence on PM's profile, we can ask an activist to ask PM to put that sentence om PM profile.

So our SPECIFIC request to actvist we meet can be be

(1.1) can you ask PM to put Hp2010 vdo on PM's FB twi profile? . (2.1) can you ask PM to put Gov Plot List on PM's website

(3.1) can you ask PM to put Mineral output royalty data on PM's website

And next is more interesting. We can ask activist to ask his seniro to take above 3 steps !!! . (1.1) can you ask your senior to ask PM to put Hp2010 vdo on PM's FB profile? . (2.1) can you ask your senior to ask PM to put Govt plot list on PM's website? . (3.1) can you ask your senior to ask PM to put mineral output and royalty collected for each 1sqmt plot every month on PM's website? . these 3 sentences, will be imo fastest way for us to convince an activist that his senior is real or fake

head of gathering and Misuse of courts admin etc

One most common misuse of courts admin legislatures has been - existing manufacturers with large market share try to shut down factories of smaller players, particularly newcomers.

And another common misuse is to create "victimless crimes" and collect fines and bribes from "criminals" who commit victimless crimes !! One such victimless crimes is manufacturing and selling 'illegal' liquor , drugs.

And there are many more. eg land loot, bank loot, mineral loot, adding pollutants in water food medicine, forced medication etc

Common knowledge helps in reduce above misuses. CK is sentences or images or data that all know, and all know that all know. CK may be just a belief or may be fact or a lie. And it can be belief known as belief or a belief which acceopted as fact.

Now weekly or fortnighly or even monthly gathering has been one procedure which enabled population to obtain and communicate information, and create common knowledge.

Other process that create communucation and common knoweldge are mass media , jury , referendum, elections and recall. Jury is gathering of 12, but 1000s of such gathering every week across country and across year creates same communication as if there was one gathering of whole population in a year. Refrendum also creates common knowledge because each has to vote and before voting, he will discuss. And so does election and recall.

Now all these tools - mass media, jury, referendum, election, recall - need govt or elitemen funding. And their support.

Now all gatherings need a moderator who decides who will speak for how many minutes. In religious gathering, priest or maulvi is the moderator, and also often a speaker. But they also allow or disallow others to speak.

Now if elitemen have strong control over priests/maulvies, then elitemen's ability to crush newcoming manufacturer will increase. However, if elitemen have LESS control over priests/maulvies, then elitemen will have less control in crushing newcoming manufacturers.

Imo, Popeism (ie a central Pope will appoint all priests) enabled elitemen to increase control over all priests, via elitemen control over Pope and Cardinals. And elite manufacturers will use it to crush newcomers

.

And this was imo main reason why manufacturing under Islamic Kings was better than Christian Kings bwteween 600 ad to 1200 ad. Otherwise, when Arab conquered Jeruslam in 638 ad, the Arabs were far far less wealthier than Kings and officers who were ruling Jerusalem. And Arab armies were not very small, but smaller than Armies of so called the them Holy Roman Eastern Empire, which ruled over middle east. Despite less wealth, they were able to make better weapons !!! And so despite not so big armies, there were able to dedeat quite large armies.

Also, election process reduces elitemen's control over the position. This is why most elitemen have always hated election of judges or even election of MP MLA for that matter. But activists in USA were able to ensure by 1792 that all sheriffs (full police chiefs back then) , MP MLA Prez Gov are all elected. And were able to ensure that judges are elected by 1810s. And by 1860s, most district public public prosecutors were also elected. And of course, there was JurySys. Imo, these elections and Juries weakened elitemen's ability to stop newcomers via courts admin etc. And so USA has best manufacturing,.

( Now JurySys is weakened by allowing judge to select as many as 500 of citizens as potential jurors, and then expel as many as 80% as "biased". Which makes JurySys a defacto judge trial !!! why activists in USA are supporting a weakening of JurySys a separate topic, which I will discuss later )

Supporters of namo arke soga prashantT etc are often single cause supporters.

.

So we need to cite sentence which convice them wholly or partly, that their leaders are wrong on their cause. Not try to prove that other causes are more imp

Eg1. namo supporters. They consider islamist terror as singlemost imp cause. As per them, all other issues such as corruption, poverty etc are irrelevant. They dont know about manipur issue. And also don't know that rss since year 2014 has been allowing in Bangladeshies for cash. So for them, islamist terror is so imp issue that all issues are irrelevant. Even conversion of poor Hindus from Hinduism to Buddhism or Christianity is now unimportant for them. As per them, namo with all his corruption etc is only one who can save them from islamist terror. Without namo as PM, they see islamists ending their lives and all wealth. So no matter what damages namo is doing, they want namo and no one else.

Now many of these are media created fake imagery.

They have near zero information about manipur and also not much about conversion of poor Hindus into Buddhism and Christianity.

Eg2 raga supporters. Muslims believe that namo will end their citizenship using caa nrc and expel them. And raga is a savior . And many sc st once believe that rss namo will end caste based reservation and so they fear from rss. And they see raga as savior

Eg3 arke supporters. They dislike raga namo for valid reasons. And see arke as some warrior.

Eg4 prashanT supporters. Some of his supporters are just spiritual people, who just want moksha even if bharat becomes another Ukraine or worse. To some, he has convinced that global warming is only relevant problem and all problems such as poverty, corruption, collapse of religion , collapse of nation are irrelevant. And only PrasanhT has solution to co2 problem !!! PT has also said that removing poverty will increase global warming and so attempt to remove poverty is bad for poor !!! And he adds usual anti rich masala talks creating an anti establishment aura.

So 'focusing on only one cause, and ignore ALL other causes' is one major problem with their supporters. They all have been convinced to focus only on one problem and ignore all other problems.

So asking them to spend time on any other cause B , needs to first show, thar B seriously impacts their imp cause A.

And next, that RRP solution to A or B is better than namk
