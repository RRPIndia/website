**Proposed 3 line law can reduce poverty, corruption, MNCs domination in 4 months**

The eminent intellectuals of India have claimed that problems such as (a)MNC owners’ domination in politics (b)poverty (c)corruption in police (d)corruption/nepotism in judges (e)corruption in education (f)Bangladeshi infiltration etc are so difficult problems, that it would take at decades of Herculean efforts to reduce these problems. The eminent intellectuals of India have categorically said that no six-month solution exists to any one of these problems. And here comes Rahul Chimanbhai Mehta (author), and boldly claims that a mere three line proposed Gazette Notification - can reduce MNC domination, poverty, corruption, nepotism, Bangladeshi problem etc
and that too all within mere 4 months !!

He call this proposed Gazette Notification as Transparent Complain Filing Procedure aka TCP for short. And I further boast that the proposed TCP-GN-draft (GN = Gazette Notification = order issued by Ministers) has no negative side effects ; and the proposed TCP-GN-draft is 100% Constitutional; and it is in synch with all the existing laws. And it doesn’t need a legislation from
MPs\MLAs – a Gazette Notification will suffice as proposed TCP-GN-draft already come under existing powers of PM
