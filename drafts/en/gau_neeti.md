[Comment: Collectors can create such a system that voters can register their acceptance through SMS, ATM and mobile app.
.
Range Voting — The Prime Minister or the Chief Minister can create such a system that voters can score between -100 to 100 points to a candidate. If the voter only registers yes, it will be considered equal to 100. If the voter does not register his acceptance, it will be considered as zero. But if the voter gives points then only the marks given by him will be valid. This range voting process is superior to the acceptance system, and provides immunity from Arrow's Useless Impossibility Theorem.]
