I , RRP and RR movement are indebted to Shri Bahubalibhai Shah and Gujarat Samachar, When I gave my election advt in year 2009, all newspaper adked for 100% extra, while GS printed at rate. And its HUGE thing, because other large parties do NOT like. And no newspaper printed by anti-EVM advt, which GS did. And no TV channel was willing to show EvmBlackGlass demo, while GSTV did show EvmBlackGlass demo. 

So I am deeply indebted to Gujarat Samachar familiy. 

I request all to send this tweet.
