Why EVM has not yet been banned in Bharat

   { Right to Recall Party & a Group of 40 Unrecognized Parties }  

The ruling party, which is currently the BJP under Narendra Modi, supports the use of EVMs and VVPATs with black glass. However, it is important to understand how the key leaders and presidents of opposition parties also align with the use of these machines. 
Furthermore, we must analyze why they pretend to oppose EVMs and VVPATs after losing elections

## 01. The Opposition’s Inaction on EVMs
The Election Commission’s website states that a maximum of 384 candidates can contest an election using EVMs. Despite knowing this, why didn’t opposition party president's field more than 384 candidates? Had they publicly declared their intention to do so, the Election Commission would have been compelled to conduct elections using ballot papers instead of EVMs, rendering the machines obsolete. This strategy was successfully implemented in 2010 by Chandrasekhar Rao’s Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), when the maximum limit was only 64 candidates per EVM. TRS fielded more than 64 candidates, forcing the Election Commission to switch to ballot papers. Today, the threshold is 384 candidates. While it may be difficult to implement this strategy, opposition party presidents did not even attempt it.
(Our Right to Recall Party, lacks the financial resources to field so many candidates, but we believe that merely announcing the intention to do so would pressure the Election Commission into using ballot papers.)

## 02. Lack of State-Level Legal Action Against EVMs - 
Article 328 of the Indian constitution empowers state governments to enact laws in coordination with the State Election Commission to determine the mode of conducting municipal, panchayat, district council, and even state assembly elections. Yet, no opposition party has passed a law mandating ballot paper voting in their respective states instead of using EVMs and VVPATs with black glass and light sensors.

## 04. Ignoring Proven Vulnerabilities of EVMs 
In 2010, election official Shri Hariprasad demonstrated how Electronic votes could be manipulated (hacked) in EVMs, by stealing a real EVM from a collector’s office. The video of this demonstration is still available on YouTube. However, no party president has made an effort to publicize it.  youtu.be/ZlCOj1dElDY 

Moreover, municipal, panchayat, and district council elections still use EVMs without VVPATs, meaning voters cannot verify their votes—despite a 2013 Supreme Court order mandating VVPATs with EVMs. No EVM-opposing lawyer has filed a petition to enforce this ruling in the upcoming local elections, exposing their hypocrisy. No party president speaks or acts on this issue either.
## 05. No Formal Opposition to EVMs by Political Parties -
No EVM-opposing party has ever written a letter to the Election Commission requesting the cessation of elections using EVMs, nor has such a letter been publicly displayed on social media or any public platform. This suggests that they have not formally opposed EVMs and are merely opposing EVMs verbally.
The "INDIA" alliance (a coalition of opposition parties) may claim to have sent letters, but the Election Commission can dismiss them by stating that it only recognizes registered parties and voters, not coalitions.

## 06. Demonstrating EVM Manipulation and Media Apathy - 
The EVM Hatao Sena (an anti-EVM wing of the Right to Recall Party, supported by over 40 small parties before the 2024 Lok Sabha elections) created a demo EVM in 2019, ( by Shri Rahul Chimanbhai Mehta ji, a Computer Engineer, Scientist & a lawyer, graduated from IIT-Delhi, MS in Rutgers Univ. USA) to expose how the VVPAT paper slip votes can be manipulated, hence enabling 100% matching of control unit’s electronic votes & VVPAT’s paper slip votes using black glass and light sensors in VVPATs.  youtu.be/fmLzPdNpxg0
This demonstration was privately or publicly witnessed by several prominent political leaders, including:
Congress leaders like Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi, Digvijay Singh, Udit Raj, Prithviraj Chavan, Ashok Gehlot, Bunty Patil, Sunil Kedar. Many losing candidates from Congress, Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray’s faction leaders like Aditya Thackeray and Sanjay Raut. NCP leaders like Sharad Pawar, Supriya Sule, Jayant Patil, Anil Deshmukh, Arvind Kejriwal and others.
If these leaders personally witnessed the demonstration, it is likely that other opposition leaders were informed as well. If they were not, or if the demo was not widely publicized, it raises serious doubts about the sincerity of their opposition to EVMs.
(We believe that opposition parties, particularly Congress, used our EVM demo strategically during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, only publicizing it enough to negotiate seat gains with the BJP.)

## 07. Why Do Opposition Leaders want to Keep EVMs Alive Even After Losing ?
Now, let’s explore why opposition party leaders continue to keep EVMs and VVPATs with black glass relevant, even after losing elections.
Now, let’s understand why the opposition party’s leader wants to keep EVMs with black-glass, light sensor VVPATs relevant even after losing the election.

### 7.1. The Role of Foreign-Sponsored Paid Media - 
Foreign-sponsored news channels, newspapers, YouTube, Facebook, and other social media platforms play a crucial role in keeping certain political parties alive despite their corruption. These media outlets manipulate public perception, ensuring that corrupt parties remain dominant.
If this foreign-backed Paid media starts openly exposing the corruption of such parties, their supporters will abandon them, their offices will shut down, and their leaders may end up in jail. This proves that corrupt parties need the support of foreign-sponsored Paid media to survive.
If any party leader genuinely opposes the EVMs, VVPAT black-glass / light sensors , which allegedly contain a foreign-programmed fraudulent mechanism, then the same foreign-sponsored paid media will destroy that party. Since the corruption of these parties is already well known, they prefer losing elections through EVMs with VVPAT black-glass, light sensors  over completely shutting down or going to jail. 

### 7.2. The Strategy Behind ONLY Pretending to Oppose EVMs and VVPATs & not actually opposing  -  
By only pretending to oppose EVMs and black-glass VVPATs, these leaders hope to collaborate with foreign forces in the future and win elections fraudulently. This way, they can continue to remain in power even after indulging in corruption—just as the BJP is allegedly doing today.

### 7.3. Using EVMs to Control Internal Party Opponents - 
If someone within the party rises against the leadership, EVMs and black-glass / Light sensor VVPATs can be used to ensure that internal rivals lose elections. This discourages opposition within the party and allows family dynasties to continue their rule.

## 08. Clarifications on Issues Raised by Party Leaders, EVM Opponents, and Election Commission Decisions - 

### 8.1. Is Opposing Only EVMs Enough?
Today, EVMs are safeguarded by black-glass & light sensor VVPATs. If an EVM opponent does not explain how votes on VVPAT paper slips can be manipulated, then either they don’t understand the fraud or are deliberately hiding it—whether they belong to the opposition, ruling party, or any self proclaimed anti-EVM lawyers. 

### 8.2. Will Counting All VVPAT Slips Detect Fraud ?
The EVM Hatao Sena, founded by Shri Rahul Chimanbhai Mehta, has demonstrated that both electronic votes on the counting unit and paper votes on the black-glass VVPAT can be simultaneously altered. This means that even if all VVPAT slips are counted, fraud will not be detected. The opposition leaders, especially Rahul Gandhi, are aware of this but continue to demand VVPAT slip counting.       

### 8.3. Can EVMs Be Hacked?
The EVM Hatao Sena does not claim that EVMs are hacked. However, it claims that EVMs imported from the Netherland’s company NXP, contain pre-installed fraudulent programs in their chips. These programs allegedly manipulate both electronic and VVPAT votes with a 100% match. While they do not emphasize hacking as the method of fraud, they insist that the fraud originates from pre-programmed software inside the EVMs(inside tempering).

### 8.4. Other Election Irregularities ,some issues raised regarding elections include :
- Alteration of 74 lakh names in the voter list
- EVM batteries showing 100% charge despite prolonged use
- A surge in voting activity towards the end of polling
- Disappearance of 20 lakh EVMs
- Lack of access to election-related documents and video recordings

However, none of these points conclusively prove that votes were stolen via EVM tempering ( black-glass / Light sensor VVPATs ) . Instead, these weak and possibly misleading issues are being used to dilute the real opposition to EVMs. This appears to be a conspiracy by fake EVM opponents, certain lawyers, and possibly the BJP to mislead the public and weaken the case against EVM fraud.  

### 8.5. Why Doesn’t EVM Hatao Sena Present Its Demo to the Election Commission?
If the fraudulent program exists within the Election Commission’s own EVMs, then selected officials within the commission may be facilitating the fraud. In such a scenario, approaching the Election Commission is pointless.
Nonetheless, on 12th February 2024, EVM Hatao Sena (Right to Recall Party) formally requested an EVM from the Election Commission by giving a DD of ₹40,000, Demanding real EVM VVPAT , if provided with the machine and its password, they claim they can demonstrate how the fraud works.

### 8.6. Why Doesn’t EVM Hatao Sena Present Its Demo in Court?
During the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, EVM Hatao Sena held more than 15 press conferences across the country. Their findings were covered by major news channels, YouTube platforms, and newspapers even after the Maharashtra Assembly elections. If the evidence was presented so publicly, why hasn’t any High Court or Supreme Court judge taken suo moto cognizance of the matter? Also Prashant Bhushan against an PIL against EVMs during Lok Sabha 2024 in Supreme Court just theoretically explain the voting theft by EVM Black Glass and didn't demanded EVM black glass demonstration before the Supreme Court judges.
EVM Hatao Sena does not trust government-appointed judges and lacks the financial resources to pursue a legal case. Instead, they believe in mass movements and public demonstrations.

### 8.7. Why Doesn’t EVM Hatao Sena Prove Fraud in the Election Commission’s Hackathon ?
The Election Commission only invites experts to hack EVMs, but EVM Hatao Sena argues that the real issue is pre-installed fraudulent programs within the microcontroller i.e. inside tempering. While the Election Commission insists on proving fraud through hacking, EVM Hatao Sena maintains that the fraud occurs due to embedded software rather than real-time hacking.

### 8.8. Can fraud be detected if VVPAT slips are given to voters and they manually insert them into a separate ballot box? 

**\#MeriParchi_MereHaath**

The thermal papers used in VVPAT are easily available in the market and are commonly used for billing purposes in various businesses. This makes it entirely possible for activists of a losing party to carry multiple slips of VVPAT thermal paper concealed within a single slip and deposit them in the VVPAT box. This could manipulate vote counts and lead to the election being nullified.
Some so called Anti EVM leaders ( actual EVM supporters ) also mislead the public, saying the voters should get the VVPAT vote receipt in their hand , sign on it and put in another VVPAT box, the other problem with this proposal including the above problems is, say in Vidhan Sabha there are approximately 3 lakh voters and in a Lok Sabha there are approximately 15 to 20 lakh voters, getting signature specimen of all this many voters and matching with the signature in VVPAT vote receipt is practically next to impossible.
Back in 2010, the Election Commission had already dismissed this proposal, sighting this genuine reason, and all political parties had accepted this decision. Yet, for some reason, Rahul Gandhi is bringing up this issue again, wasting the time of party activists.

### 8.9. Can Only the Ruling Party (Narendra Modi's BJP) Manipulate EVMs and VVPATs?
The microcontrollers and programs used in India's EVMs and black-glass / light sensor VVPATs are manufactured by the Dutch company NXP, based in the Netherlands. However, no microchip manufacturing company can function for long without support from Silicon Valley in the U.S. This raises a strong suspicion that the U.S. is involved.
>*Silicon Valley in the U.S. is home to the design of microchips, high-purity semiconductor materials, chemicals, and advanced equipment necessary for microchip production. This allows the U.S. to influence companies like NXP according to its interests.*

The internal program of these microchips is inserted by foreign engineers, and only they can access it. They hold the password and the necessary resources for manipulation. Hence, neither the ruling nor opposition parties in India can execute election fraud alone. It would require the involvement of foreign entities, select Indian political figures (especially from the ruling BJP), and specific officials within the Election Commission.
### 8.10. Why Doesn’t BJP Win All Elections If EVMs Are Rigged ?
Foreign powers collaborating with major party leaders prioritize keeping EVMs and black-glass , light sensor VVPATs operational rather than ensuring the victory of any one party, whether BJP or Congress. By dividing power between different parties, they ensure the continued use of EVMs. They understand the story of the "hens that lays golden eggs" very well and do not want to kill the hen all at once.

### 8.11. How is it possible to receive 100% battery in EVMs even after use?
If those protesting against the EVMs claim that the machines have been replaced, they are deliberately trying to divert attention from the real issue of vote theft happening in EVMs. By accusing certain machines of being swapped during "one election," they are attempting to suppress the fact that vote theft can occur in every election via the EVMs. If there has been any dishonesty replacing EVMs, it is the fault of the Election Commission, not the EVM machine.

### 8.12. Allegation of adding names to the voter list within a 6-month interval?
If millions of names are added to the voter list in a short period, how can we ensure these votes will go to only one party, unless vote theft is happening in the EVMs? Despite our demonstration making this clear, why is the opposition staying silent on it? This accusation seems to be related only to "one election," while we are demonstrating how vote theft through EVM programming can happen in every election. If there has been any fraud in the voter list addition, the Election Commission is responsible, it’s an administrative issue and not the EVM vote theft issue, and this seems to be an attempt to cover up the theft happening within the EVMs.

### 8.13. Why was there a rapid increase in voting during the last hours of the election day?
In the final hours, a surge of votes went to the ruling party, the BJP. How is this possible without a theft program in the EVMs? Why isn’t the opposition demonstrating and explaining this theft to everyone? How will the Form 17C and Form 20 match up? Sometimes, voters who arrive late are allowed to vote without a slip from the booth officer, otherwise, they might argue with the officer. This causes rapid voting at the end, and the polling officers enter votes later.

### 8.14. Are members of the ruling party or individuals close to Prime Minister Modi holding top positions in the Election Commission ?
This is a foolish accusation. Every party appoints its own people to top positions. Did Congress, when in power, appoint RSS people to top posts? If the opposition wants the Election Commission to work honestly for the citizens, there should be a Right to Recall over the Election Commissioner (i.e., citizens should be able to replace the Election Commissioner through public opinion when needed, forcing the Commissioner to work for citizens and not for the ruling or opposition parties).

### 8.15. Is the replacement of Election Commissioner Rajeev Kumar or any commissioner a victory ?
The opposition has raised such accusations to focus on the Election Commission rather than the EVMs and black glass VVPATs, where the theft is occurring. This is a strategy of party leaders to shift the focus from EVM theft to Election Commission theft by pushing for a replacement of the Election Commissioner, which would make citizens and their candidates happy & divert real anti-EVM movement .

### 8.16. Why are you publicizing your demonstration to prove vote manipulation in EVMs? Is this an attempt to claim credit ?
Currently, the protection of electronic vote theft in EVMs is through the paper slip vote from the VVPAT, so without showing the theft of the paper slip, the theft in EVMs cannot be proven. Only the "EVM Hatao Sena" (Right to Recall Party) is showing this theft through their EVM Black Glass & EVM Light Sensor demo. If someone wants credit, they should create their own demo machine and spread it to take the credit. We are even willing to provide them with a machine provided they show these demo to atleast 500 people.

### 8.17. A renowned Supreme Court lawyer has threatened the Election Commission with the cancellation of elections after the declaration of results, invoking Article 59 of the People’s Representation Act (PRA). He claims that the provision mandates the exclusive use of ballot papers for voting.
Reality: Article 59 of the PRA states:
>“Manner of voting at elections.—At every election where a poll is taken, votes shall be given by ballot in such manner as may be prescribed, and, save as expressly provided by this Act, no votes shall be received by proxy:

Provided that the votes at every election to fill a seat or seats in the Council of States shall be given by open ballot.”
However, this interpretation ignores the overriding provision in Article 61A, which states:
>“Voting machines at elections.—Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or the rules made thereunder, the giving and recording of votes by voting machines in such manner as may be prescribed, may be adopted in such constituency or constituencies as the Election Commission may, having regard to the circumstances of each case, specify.
Explanation.—For the purpose of this section, ‘voting machine’ means any machine or apparatus, whether operated electronically or otherwise, used for giving or recording of votes; and any reference to a ballot box or ballot paper in this Act or the rules made thereunder shall, save as otherwise provided, be construed as including a reference to such voting machine wherever such voting machine is used at any election.”

Conclusion: Article 61A clearly authorizes the use of EVMs, overriding the general provision of Article 59. Thus, the lawyer's claim that only ballot voting is permitted is factually incorrect and misleading. By promoting this false narrative, he appears to be undermining the genuine concerns raised by the EVM Hatao Sena of vote manipulation due to EVM Black glass & EVM Light sensor, and in doing so, is effectively shielding the current EVM-based voting system having VVPATs. This misdirection seems to hijack & destroy real anti-EVM movement across the country & protect EVMs. 

## 9. Technical Clarifications After Demonstration by the ‘EVM Hatao Sena’
### (9.1) How do manipulation occurs If I saw my VVPAT vote slip being print,displayed then cut & drop ?
9.1(i)  1st mathematical logic ( Selective Manipulation of Votes ) - 
In Vidhan Sabha elections, only around 10–15% of seats need to be manipulated to form a government. This implies that vote manipulation occurs only in these specific constitue
