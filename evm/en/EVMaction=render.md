## कुछ सवालों के जवाब

1. [जब चुनाव आयोग बुलाता है (Evm चेलेंज, हेकेथॉन आदि) तब Evm विरोधी क्यों नहीं जाते](http://127.0.0.1:8080/w/index.php/EVM_Challange "EVM Challange")
2. [क्या EVM सच में इतना नुकसानदायक है?](http://127.0.0.1:8080/w/index.php/%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE_EVM_%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%9A_%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%82_%E0%A4%87%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BE_%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%95_%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%88%3F "क्या EVM सच में इतना नुकसानदायक है?")

## Fake EVM opposition

1. [Fake Opposition of Rahul Gandhi](http://127.0.0.1:8080/w/index.php/Fake_Opposition_of_Rahul_Gandhi "Fake Opposition of Rahul Gandhi")
2. [Meri Parchi, Mere Hath](http://127.0.0.1:8080/w/index.php/Fake_Opposition_of_Rahul_Gandhi#give_VVPAT_paper_slip_in_voter_hand= "Fake Opposition of Rahul Gandhi")

if a constituency has 400 candidates then, eci will have to use paper ballot. CU limit is 384 candidates. . Deposit of SC ST candidate is rs 12500 . So 400 candidate deposits will cost Rs 50 lakh. Plus say rs 10 lakh form filling expenses. So rs 60 lakh max per constituency. . So Congress or aap can easily force ECI to use paper ballots by spending rs 50 lakh per constituency

  

  

- RaGa is now taking following line so that Evm lives.*

- WHAT CAN WE DO?*

Raga is taking following line

- (1) Hijack and claim EvmBlackGlass demo* : RaGa will show EvmBG demo as if demo was created by Topinathan or APatel , and that congress created this EvmBG demo and congress is promoting this EvmBG demo and all that.

- (2) Form committee option* : RaGa will agree with suggestion from media to "form committee to improve EVM" !!! Commitee will consit of esxprt from public like Topinathan , APatel and exprt from ECI

- (3) Till then, no ballot paper OPTION and continue EVM as is* : And till comittee makes better design, vote using existing evm and no ballot paper option and no EvmHatao and no bring ballot back !!!

So what should we DO to either defeat him or make his victory expensive? Using whatever using limited time, money, people etc we have.

Pls put YOUR suggestion as separate post and pls put ONLY link in comment to this FB post - [https://fb.com/1749456042577792](https://fb.com/1749456042577792)

  

We at Right to Recall Party started *demo based* EvmHatao andolan. And it was picking up slowly.

To hijack and destroy our demo based andolan, congress leader Kharge says " congress will start EvmHatao andolan".

- This thug supported Evm for 24 years*.

And now he says "हमको EVM से चुनाव नहीं चाहिए। हमें बैलेट पेपर से चुनाव चाहिए। छोटे तबकों के लोगों का जो वोट हमे मिल रहा है वो फिजूल जा रहा है। हम दूसरी विपक्षी दलों से भी बात करेंगे। हमने जैसे 'भारत जोड़ो यात्रा' निकाली थी, वैसे ही बैलेट पेपर से चुनाव के लिए एक देशव्यापी जनांदोलन चलाएंगे।"

As long as OUR demo based andolan is going on, congress thugs will continue their andolan. Moment our demo based andolan stops, these congress rascals will again start supporting EVMs !!!

- So I request all to make demo equipment and show the demo to as many as possible*

## Stand of youtubers

Youtubers say that if they show mahatma hariprasad video or my evmblackglass video, then youtube demonetizes channel.

There is no legal action by Eci or Modi govt.

And YT is not deleting video either. Not of well know YTbers.

Despite this, forget my EBG video, YTbers don't want to show even mhp2010 !!!

So YTbers are for money only. Not awareness etc
