## give VVPAT paper slip in voter hand

How Rahul Gandhi proposal that
>give VVPAT paper slip in voter hand

actually means

> continue VVPAT as is, and do NOT bring ballot paper

written by - **Rahul Chimanbhai Mehta** inventor EvmBlackGlass magic demo B Tech, IIT Delhi

To kill **bring ballot paper back** andolan, Rahul Gandhi has started _give evm paper slip in voter hand_ nonsense.

----
  
We have proposed that ECI **must give ballot paper to all voters** and **ECI may continue with EVM at booth**. So voter will have a choice. So our proposal is **keep ballot paper and remove EVM**, OR **keep ballot paper and may EVM also co-exist**.

Rahul Gandhi says

> keep vvpat lid (dhakkan) open, so that voter can get VVPAT paper slip in his own hand, and then voter will fold it and drop it in a ballot box

The problem is, and Rahul Gandhi is in my opinion well aware of this, that

1. if VVPAT lid is opened, then VVPAT will go on in error mode and stop taking votes. Because VVPAT thinks that it is being manhandled or tempered. Also,
2. the bin (dibba) has to be replaced by a flat tray. Also,
3. if vvpat is opened, then light will go inside VVPAT and then again VVPAT goes in error mode.

So

> keep lid open, give vvpat paper slip in voter hand

means - **16 lakh VVPATs** which are in collector warehouse have to be sent to factory, redesigned, new code has to be put, and then sent back to collector warehouse.

### Rahul Gandhi proposal is a 1 year project

So Rahul Gandhi is deliberately putting a proposal which will give a VALID excuse to ECI that **you must give us 1 year** !!! And given the material requirement, courts and all technical people will also have to agree.

So this means existing LS 2024 elections will go on with existing VVPATs as is. Whereas ballot paper OPTION can be given to voter by collectors **within 1 week**. Because postal ballots are paper ballots and so design is ready. ROs print 10000 postal ballots in a loksabha, and now he has to print 20 lakh. And today India has 95 crore voters of which 65 crore live in municipalities and Panchayats, where elections still go by ballot papers. So staff knows how to manage ballot paper. So ballot paper only or ballot paper + EVM both proposals can be implemented in a week.

Also, Rahul Gandhi is NOT publicizing **EvmBlackGlass magic demo**. So ECI can merrily and validly say "the paper is falling in bin, so why do you insist that voter must get paper in his own hand" ?? And audience will see nothing wrong in ECI argument.

### Additional problems are

1. vvpat paper slip is small 3 inch * 3 inch paper. . Anyone can print 4 such slips at home and put in box
2. as many as high as 2% to 5% voters may accidentally put slip in pocket and take slip home.
3. the slip is so light weight that in month of may 2024, where voting booths have fans at full speed, some 2% to 5% slips msy kust fly away
4. the symbol on slip even after folding is visible because paper is thin. So voter can be intimidated And so on.

But lets focus FIRST on fatal flaw, that

- keeping vvpat lid OPEN needs redesign and recoding 16 lakh vvpats, and its NOT possible in 3 months.

One min vdo . Why Rahul.gandhi proposal of givibg vvpat slip in voter hand is imo senseless. So this nonsense of give vvpat paper slip in voter hand will be instantly rejected by court.

**And I had communicated this properly to many congress leaders.**

---

So imo, Rahul Gandhi is a FAKE OPPOSITION. He gives lip service against EVM to ensure that anti EVM voters stay with Rahul Gandhi and end up wasting time and energy. And Rahul Gandhi is giving proposal which will enable ECI to continue VVPAT as is !!!

### So Solution?

Those who want ballot paper should inform all that proposal to give ballot paper ONLY or ballot paper EVM both OPTION to voter are only viable proposals

And Rahul Gandhi proposal to give vvpat paper slip in voter hand is nonsense, meant to defeat the movement.
